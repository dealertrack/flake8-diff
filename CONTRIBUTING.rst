Documentation
=============

  * The header order::

      ========
      Header 1
      ========

      Header 2
      ========

      Header 3
      --------

      Header 4
      ~~~~~~~~
  * Perform at least basic spelling checks;
  * Use `gender-neutral language
    <https://www.google.com/search?q=gender+neutral+language>`_ (`singular they
    <https://www.google.co.za/search?q=singular+they>`_ is great!);


Reviewing
=========

All code that is merged into flake8-diff must be reviewed by at least one person
other than an author of the change.

While perfection is a noble goal it often leads to an idea that improvement
without achieving perfection is not an improvement. Improvements need only be
that, improvements.
